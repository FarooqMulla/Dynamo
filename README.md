## Yaws - Yet another Swift Web Server

Yaws is a minimal, 100% Swift, single file implementation of a Web server supporting SSL
that can also be used from Objective-C. It can serve static or dynamic content and
when used from the command line and includes "processors" for acting as a http and https
proxy on your local host for debugging and tracing.

Incorporating the YawsWebServer in your web server or application is simple. The initialiser
takes a port number and a list of "processors" (applications or document processors)
that will each be presented the incoming requests in the order specified and have the
option of processing them. The basic code pattern for initialisation in your app delegate is:

```Swift
    let serverPort: UInt16 = 8080
    YawsWebServer( portNumber: serverPort, processors: [
        YawsExampleAppProcessor( pathPrefix: "/example" ),
        TickTackToe(),
        YawsSSLProxyProcessor(),
        YawsProxyProcessor(),
        YawsDocumentProcessor( documentRoot: NSBundle.mainBundle().resourcePath! ),
    ] )

    webView.mainFrame.loadRequest( NSURLRequest( URL: NSURL( string: "http://localhost:\(serverPort)" )! ) )
```

See AppDelegate.swift in the example project for further details. 
A processor runs in it's own thread and is an instance of subclass 
of "YawsProcessor" that has the following signature:

```Swift
    @objc public enum YawsProcessed : Int {
    case
        NotProcessed, // does not recognise the request
        Processed, // has processed the request
        ProcessedAndReusable // "" and connection may be reused
    }

    public class YawsProcessor: NSObject {

        @objc func process( yawsClient: YawsHTTPConnection ) -> YawsProcessed {
            fatalError( "YawsProcessor: Abstract method process() called" )
        }

    }
```

Other than this, once a YawsProcessor has recognised a request it can process it
in any manner it pleases accessing the client through the YawsHTTPConnection class.
It returns .ProcessedAndReusable if the connection can be reused (as can be done
with HTTP/1.1) This requires a "Content-Length" HTTP header value to have been set.

A user written subclass of one particular subclass of YawsProcessor, "YawsApplicationProcessor"
receives the  query string, POST data and any Cookies preprocessed and is used for dynamic content.
Application processors must provide a "pathPrefix" that will be matched against the
first part of the URL to distinguish them from each other and the default document
serving processor. After parsing the request processing is handed over to the user
written implementation of the following function.

```Swift
    @objc public func processRequest( out: YawsHTTPConnection, pathInfo: String, parameters: [String:String], cookies: [String:String] ) {
        fatalError( "Application Subclass responsibility" )
    }
```

Note: while the "YawsHTTPConnection" object representing the request is transient,
the processor instance is persistent for the life of the server and must implement sessions
or state as it chooses.

A further subclass of YawsApplicationProcessor, "YawsHTMLAppProcessor" provides
functions to generate balanced HTML tags easily using functions. for example:

```Swift
    out.print( html( nil ) + head( title( "Table Example" ) +
        style( "body, table { font: 10pt Arial" ) ) + body( nil ) )

    if parameters["width"] == nil {
        out.print( h3( "Quick table creation example" ) )
        out.print(
            form( ["method":"GET"],
                table(
                    tr( td( "Width: " ) + td( input( ["type":"textfield", "name":"width"] ) ) ) +
                    tr( td( "Height: " ) + td( input( ["type":"textfield", "name":"height"] ) ) ) +
                    tr( td( ["colspan":"2"], input( ["type": "submit"] )) )
                )
            )
        )
    }
```

In these tag functions an optional dictionary of attributes for the tag can be supplied 
and a contents of nil specifies not to close the tag.

A final processor, the "YawsDocumentProcessor" generally takes the end of the chain
serving documents from a document root (which can be your appâ€™s resource directory.)
A subclass of this, the "MultiHostProcessor" can be used to implement multiple
sites on one server using the "Host:" http request header. In this case it's
up to any dynamic content to make sure it runs on the right host.

### Design

YawsWebServer has been implemented using BSD sockets rather than Apple's CFSocket as I wasn't convinced 
it was any less low level and I didn't want to tangle with the main run loop. This also simplifies the
parsing of the HTTP headers as they come in using the venerable "fgets". If you don't share this vision
the classes YawsWebServer and YawsHTTPConnection where all this code is concentrated can be re-implemented
without affecting the basic architecture of the server or affecting any of the "processor" code.

One thing CFSocket/NSStreams does give however is support for an SSL server so a way had to be found
to turn the "push" of CFSockets to the "pull" of the Yaws code. The solution was to run a separate
CFSocket based SSL server as a proxy relaying decrypted data to a "surrogate" Yaws server on localhost
satisfying both architectures. The code to generate the required certificates in DDKeychain.[nm] was taken from

YawsHTMLAppProcessor borrows it's design from the original Perl CGI module the grand-daddy of all dynamic web
content. This is my third and by far the cleanest Web server I've implemented in various languages 
and combines the experience but thankfully none of the code from the "PSP" and "jhttpd" servers.

Dynamic content can be coded entirely in Swift and one interesting use case is that it
can be used inside an iOS or OS X app. This allows you to write a "lag free" portable web 
interface connecting to the embedded server on the local device rather than a remote server. 
This is shown in the two examples included in the release.
