## Yaws - Yet another Swift Web Server

Yaws is a minimal single file implementation of a Web server written
Swift that can also be used from Objective-C. It can serve static or dynamic content
when used from the command line and includes "processors" for proxying http and https
requests on your local host for debugging.

Incorporating the YawsWebServer in your web server or application is simple. The initialiser
takes a port number and a list of "processors" (applications or document processors)
that will each be presented the incoming requests in the order specified and have the
option of processing them. The basic code pattern for initialisation in your app delegate is:

```Swift
    let serverPort: UInt16 = 8080
    YawsWebServer( portNumber: serverPort, processors: [
        YawsExampleAppProcessor( pathPrefix: "/example" ),
        TickTackToe(),
        YawsSSLProxyProcessor(),
        YawsProxyProcessor(),
        YawsDocumentProcessor( documentRoot: NSBundle.mainBundle().resourcePath! ),
    ] )

    webView.mainFrame.loadRequest( NSURLRequest( URL: NSURL( string: "http://localhost:\(serverPort)" )! ) )
```

A processor runs in it's own thread and is an instance of subclass of "YawsProcessor" that returns one of three values:

```Swift
    @objc public enum YawsProcessed : Int {
    case
        NotProcessed, // does not recognise the request
        Processed, // has processed the request
        ProcessedAndReusable // "" and connection may be reused
    }

    public class YawsProcessor: NSObject {

        @objc func process( yawsClient: YawsHTTPConnection ) -> YawsProcessed {
            fatalError( "YawsProcessor: Abstract method process() called" )
        }

    }
```

Other than this, once a YawsProcessor has recognised a request it can process it
in any manner it chooses. It returns .ProcessedAndReusable if the connection can be
reused (as can be done with HTTP/1.1) This requires a "Content-Length" HTTP header
value to have been set.

A user written subclass of one particular subclass of YawsProcessor, "YawsApplicationProcessor"
receives the  query string, POST data and any Cookies preprocessed is used for dynamic content.
Application processors must provide a "pathPrefix" that will be matched against the
first part of the URL to distinguish them from each other and the default document
serving processor. After parsing the request processing is handed over to the user
written implementation of the following function.

```Swift
    @objc public func processRequest( out: YawsHTTPConnection, pathInfo: String, parameters: [String:String], cookies: [String:String] ) {
        fatalError( "Application Subclass responsibility" )
    }
```

Note: that while the "YawsHTTPConnection" object representing the request is transient,
the procesor instance is persistent for the life of the server and can implement sessions
or state as it chooses.

A further subclass of YawsApplicationProcessor, "YawsHTMLAppProcessor" provides
functions to generate balanced HTML tags easily using functions. for example:

```Swift
    out.print( html( nil ) + head( title( "Table Example" ) +
        style( "body, table { font: 10pt Arial" ) ) + body( nil ) )

    if parameters["width"] == nil {
        out.print( h3( "Quick table creation example" ) )
        out.print(
            form( ["method":"GET"],
                table(
                    tr( td( "Width: " ) + td( input( ["type":"textfield", "name":"width"] ) ) ) +
                    tr( td( "Height: " ) + td( input( ["type":"textfield", "name":"height"] ) ) ) +
                    tr( td( ["colspan":"2"], input( ["type": "submit"] )) )
                )
            )
        )
    }
```

In these tag functions an optional dictionary of attributes for the tag can be supplied 
and a contents of nil specifies not to close the tag.

A final processor, the "YawsDocumentProcessor" generally takes the end of the chain
serving documents from a document root (which can be your appâ€™s resource directory.)
A subclass of this, the "MultiHostProcessor" can be used to implement multiple
sites on one server using the "Host:" http request header. In this case it's
up to any dynamic content to make sure it runs on the right host.

### Design

YawsWebServer has been implemented using BSD sockets rather than Apple's CFSocket as I wasn't convinced 
it was any less low level and I didn't want to tangle with run loops. Sticking to socket level and
threading is also very fast and does not risk the possibility of deadlocks. If you don't share this decision
the classes YawsWebServer and YawsHTTPConnection where all this code is concentrated can be re-implemented
without affecting the basic architecture of the server and affecting any of the "processor" code.

"YawsHTMLAppProcessor"
borrows it's design from the original Perl CGI module - the grand-daddy of all dynamic web content.
This is my third and by far the cleanest Web server I've implemented in various languages and
combines a lot of experience but thankfully none of the code from the "PSP" and "jhttpd" servers.

Dynamic content can be coded entirely in Swift and one interesting use case is that it
can be used inside an iOS or OS X app. This allows you to write a "lag free" portable web 
interface connecting to the embedded server on the local device rather than a remote server. 
This is shown in the two examples included in the release.
